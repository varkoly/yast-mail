In http://bugzilla.suse.de/show_bug.cgi?id=23000 there's a request for
a SMTP-AUTH configuration dialog.

phadraba: UI part
mvidner: SCR part

See the commment at Mail::smtp_auth.
At this stage we will only support plain text passwords.
Sendmail requires that the password be base64 encoded, which will be
taken care of in Mail::{Read,Write} (mvidner)

Where to put the dialog: "Outgoing details..." will change from a
simple button to a menu button with 2 items. Its original function will be
available as "Masquerading...", and a new one, "Authentication..."
will lead to the new dialog.
