Restrictions of the content of fetchmailrc with respect to YaST2:

A detailed description of the fetchmailrc file as understood by
fetchmail itself is in the fetchmail(1) manual page, section "THE RUN
CONTROL FILE". The syntax is very liberal. In order for the file to be
parsable by YaST2, these limitations must be applied:

- Each global option or server entry must be terminated by a semicolon (;).
  A semicolon in a string must be written numerically, that is,
  as "\073", "\59" or "\x3b".

- Each server entry must refer to only one remote user and one local
  user.
- Strings such as user names must be always quoted.
- A server entry must have this format: (white space is not significant)

poll "my.server" protocol foo [other server options] : 
user "clark" there with password "S" is "superman" here [other user options] ;
